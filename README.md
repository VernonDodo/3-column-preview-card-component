## My process

I looked at the design and pulled out all the common elements, such as the container, the cards, the headings, the paragraphs, and the buttons. Then I created CSS classes for each for the components. I also opted for a responsive pre-styled CSS package for the following reasons:
- to avoid having to style elements down to their finest details
- to, from the start, have a responsive design, which in turn reduced the code that I had to do for media queries.

I then wrote the HTML, and, almost immediately, the design fell into place because of the CSS classes that I applied to it - this drastically reduced the total time on the project. All it needed after that, was further editing to bring the final product as close as possible to the original design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles and responsive design



### What I learned

I used a totally different approach with this project. Instead of writing the HTML first, I designed the styling, because that is what really gave the design its look. This approach also drastically reduced the time spent to complete this project.

Secondly, I opted for responsive design, which drastically reduced the number of lines of code I had to use for media queries. In previous projects, I used to write a seperate block of CSS code for media queries; this time around, I only had to apply different styling to a few components.

### Continued development

I would like to concentrate on design and wireframing, as it drastically reduces project time.

Furthermore, I would like to increase the use of pre-styled CSS now that I'm familiar and sort of comfortable with using it.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - As a pre-styled package, this was most useful in quickly putting pre-styled elements on a page. It does require a bit of further customization but not a lot. A further advantage is that it lends itself to responsive design.
- [Bootstrap Container](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/) - Bootstrap containers are so versatile in that they embody all the properties that you need in a container element. Gone are the days of elements inside of your container falling outside the parameters for it. Container properties can also be utilized to make your design fully responsive, with breakpoints for the various viewport sizes.
- [Bootstrap Columns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/columns/) - Bootstrap has an extensive collection of responsive column elements. This makes it so easy to design project that contain or are arranged on columns. The various column definitions are geared towards responsive design, with its explicit breakpoints for every column definition.
- [Bootstrap Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/) - Why design and customize a button when Bootstrap has already done it all for you? Bootstrap has taken the hassle away by providing buttons of various shapes, sizes and appearances - very little customization is needed after using a Bootstrap button.
